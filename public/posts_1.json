Overall it was a warm reception, the fluffy white dog ignored me, my belly flaps were a distraction and I spit out the treat.

I grabbed a mouthful, firmly planted myself and started yanking, there was constant muttering all of which I ignored, my focus was doing a three blanket yank. Due to the incomplete tucking in all three slid off which enabled me to yank the blankets across the room while barking, not just any barking it was a victory dance bark.

It's that time of year where some people get a little squirrelly and start cleaning, in order to combat this crazy behaviour might I suggest some alternatives, digging in the garden, it's worm rolling season so start rolling and definitely spend more time in the kitchen (small roast simmering in gravy).

I was excited to be free so I started running in circles, I didn't hear anyone pleading, that's when a neighbour came to the rescue, fussed over me until my leash was attached, I think I heard The Warden say brace yourself.

Make the best out of what you are given or keep barking until they open the fridge door, second shelf on the left, Ancient Basset Saying.",

Along the way we meet a gentleman who was shoveling his sidewalk, we stopped to talk about the weather and that's when I found my low spot and peed right in front of his shovel. Apologies were offered, eyes were averted and we scurried off, the man said it was no problem as he continued to shovel off the yellow spot.

While out on patrol I noticed movement in the window well so I decided to take a closer look and jumped in, that's when the circus started. The Warden briefly lost sight of me and sent out a search team (my brothers) to find me, they of course were enjoying the chase and someone else was in a crisis mode. The Warden was yelling 'get her out, get her out', she thought the mouse was going to attack, of course I was totally unaware of anything happening around me. My brothers eventually got me out, they rescued the mouse by using a bucket (live release), The Warden had a mild meltdown but recovered within a few hours and I continued to search every corner of the yard looking for the mouse.

The most popular method of avoiding the dreadful bath is airing out, this requires full exposure of all confined areas, the underbelly, neck folds and ear canal. It's preferable to do this with a slight breeze washing over you in order to guarantee full coverage and this will also give you that fresh linen smell that everyone loves. Another helpful hint is to avoid rolling on worm remnants during this process, it defeats the purpose of airing out, your goal is to get that fresh linen smell not a hint of worm smell. If you live with smell sensitive people try airing out on a regular basis, it'll help take the focus off of you when in confined areas, Ancient Basset Saying.",

I was sniffing each individual blade of grass when I noticed a newcomer coming towards us, I immediately laid down as one does and waited for them to get closer, as soon as the small dog was within sniffing distance he started snapping at the air and had to be restrained. That's when the cold front settled over us, The Warden raised up, stepped in front of me and shielded me from the snapping teeth.  It was a quick exchange, there was no meet and greet, little to no conversation, I returned to my sniffing and The Warden started to thaw out.

No matter what happens keep on barking, the cheap seats are expecting a show and the show must go on, even though I was unable to yank the blanket across the room I still received rave reviews and a few hey heys.

The gravy coated biscuits are at my disposal throughout the day, later in the day I'll do a yank and drag while barking for the cheap seats (always a popular event), of course there's the biscuit dance and let's not forget the burying ritual before eating my biscuit. It makes for a busy day while at the same time it's a great source of exercise, all this activity helps with ab definition and keeping your body toned.

Being rewarded for good deeds is a win win for everyone, I get what I deserve and the one handing out the reward feels empowered, at least in that moment let them feel they have full control, Ancient Basset Saying.",

The Warden is reaching out to experts in the field of barking issues about why this occurs, reach no further, I know why, it's the onset of a cheese deficiency, by the end of the day my cheese levels have depleted.

My medical team are also recovering, when dad took me to the Vets he was in his pjs and slippers, thankfully no one around to notice.  The Warden wasn't able to vacuum, which was deemed an essential service, due to the traumatic event, she spent most of the day outside hovering over me. Dad learned a valuable lesson in how to give me my meds, wrap pill in a thinly sliced piece of ham and have a second piece dangling as an incentive for when you swallow the first piece.

I eventually rescued my biscuit but the cheap seats didn't get the pleasure of my barking, they were looking rather smug that their hospital corners remained intact during the yank. After a snack and nap I'll try another round of the yank and drag while barking, this time I'll approach the lounger from different angle, with any luck I'll get to bark this time and maybe get a few hey heys.",

After this event the door is to be closed at all times, several reminders have been issued to dad and all dangling housecoats have been relocated to a secure unnamed location. While the closet was under repair I was allowed to use the housecoat for a yank and drag while barking, funny thing though I haven't seen it for a couple of years, I'm putting in a formal request to release the housecoat from captivity, it's time.",

If for some reason, god forbid, you ever run out of cheese a great substitute is a small roast simmering in gravy, taken within at least 30 minutes after you get up and definitely before you do a yank and drag while barking.

Now if you ask someone else (who has issues) why they cover the lounger with a blanket it's a completely different story, it's to protect the lounger from gravy stains, to prevent wear and tear, to contain the smell and can easily be washed and refreshed. Due to multiple yank and drag while barking issues The Warden started adding more blankets to help accommodate my burial rituals but somewhere along the line things changed, it got complicated, she developed more issues and now we're back to one blanket.

I started checking out each room and there she was, hanging up a new shower curtain, I immediately got in the attack position and started howling (as one does with something new). Her first response was 'oh for heaven sakes' (isn't she witty and charming), now I have to make an adjustment with my sensibilities. Once the curtain was hung I inched in closer to investigate the threat level, I nudged it around with my nose, howled once more and walked away.

That's when The Warden (maintenance manager) had dad spread lots of ice melt all over, once that was done I ventured out again, tentatively, nose to the ground, inching my way along until I hit the crispy grass. I had an audience watching my every step, it felt like I had cheerleaders applauding my every move. Once I had a quick pee I immediately headed back inside where I got a gentle paper towel pat down, lots of praise for my heroic adventure and one treat.

The audience has recently been upgraded from the cheap seats yelling hey hey to a crowd that loves my performance and looks on with great appreciation.  This is also an interactive sport where The Warden can participate by resetting the stage after I've completed the first round of the yank and drag while barking.",

Once the throw starts moving plant yourself on all fours and keep tugging, before you know it you'll be doing a yank and drag while barking, just keep skirting that throw all over the floor.

Except for one problem, nobody was stopping by to visit me, I pulled out all the stops, I did a little running around bobbing and weaving, I rolled on a worm, I got nothing, so I finally had to bark. Well that got some attention from The Warden, she was trying to be polite and act lady like while she quietly issued a few hey heys, I just ramped it up until she finally said we had to go inside. As a side note, yard sales would be more profitable if they offered cheese and invited the neighbours, just a suggestion for next time.",

Now I'm ready for some one on one and the only way to get the attention I deserve is to start off with a low level bark and wait for a response, if there's any kind of delay you are left with no choice but to ramp it up.  This is where it gets interesting, it always starts out with a few hey heys and then desperate times calls for desperate measures, she drops everything, calls me back over to our yard with sweet talk and lots of attention, works every time.",

Now living in an urban setting where there are bylaws about hanging your clothes outside may not have experienced this smell, so the next best thing is to find a Basset that's been sunning outside with a slight breeze and embrace their smell.

Here's a refresher course in how the game is played, with enthusiasm wait for the ball to be thrown, once it's in the air take off at full speed, pick up the ball, circle around, drop the ball on the way back, run past the thrower and start barking. Now there's a bit of a delay when the thrower goes to get the ball and encourages you to fetch again, this is where you may or may not participate. With all that running around it stirs up some great scents in the grass and you may decide to take the time to sniff and forget all about the game of fetch, it happens.",

So to help you through this difficult time I have a few pointers, the most important advice I can offer would be to extend all naps today by ten minutes. After each nap you should have a small piece of cheese, this helps with the realignment of the day. I'm only suggesting a small piece of cheese (preferably aged cheese) due to all the naps you'll need for this adjustment process. Finally and most importantly, according to all the experts, end the day with a large serving of roast simmering in gravy, then let your gravy dippers do their thing.",

Her third and final choice (my favourite) is to immediately turn around, get a piece of cheese, toss it on my lounger,  which will then motivate me to move out of her beloved chair. There's a fourth choice but it involves a third party where I steal their chair, it's a complicated scenario. Today is all about choices, be thankful you have them.",
